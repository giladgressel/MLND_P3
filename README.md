## Creating customer segments from unlabeled data.

In this project we create customer segments from unlabeled data. Using different dimensionality reduction techniques combined with clustering algorithms we are able to tell what kind of a stores are buying produce from a wholesale distributor.  There are two files to look at

+ customer_segments.pdf
+ customer_segments.ipynb

In fact they are basicaly the same, the pdf is simply exported from the jupyter notebook.
If you can read the jupyter notebook, it's got better formatting.  Otherwise enjoy the pdf.

Thanks
